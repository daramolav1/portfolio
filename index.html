        <h3>About Victor</h3>
        <p>
          I came across Thinkful after reading reviews on several other
          bootcamps. I went with Thinkful because I've seen nothing but positive
          reviews and I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can and
          finally being able to break into the tech industry as a Web
          Developer/Software Engineer
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm very passionate about web development because I love how content
          from other developers' imagination came to life. Things millions of
          people use everyday like Netflix, Instagram, and Uber gives users
          convenience and entertainment at the same time. I want the opportunity
          as well to make the lives of others easier and have my imagination
          come to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working well with others includes being willing to take responsibility
          for things that go wrong and praise for things that go right, and
          never trying to hog the glory. Also, respecting the contributions of
          everyone on your team, and welcome collaboration. Teamwork goes a long
          way and that is a necessity in becoming a successful developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time other than coding, I like to workout or play video
          games on the PlayStation 5.
